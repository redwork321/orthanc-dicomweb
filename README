This repository contains the source code of a plugin for Orthanc, the
lightweight Vendor Neutral Archive for medical imaging. This plugin
extends the RESTful API of Orthanc with DICOM Web support.


DICOM Web Support
-----------------

Currently, a basic support of the following protocols is provided:

* WADO-RS (Web Access to DICOM Objects by RESTful Services)
  http://medical.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part18.html#sect_6.5

* STOW-RS (STore Over the Web by RESTful Services)
  http://medical.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part18.html#sect_6.6

* QIDO-RS (Query based on ID for DICOM Objects by RESTful Services)
  http://medical.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part18.html#sect_6.7

The full status about the support of these protocols can be found in
the "./Status.txt" file.
